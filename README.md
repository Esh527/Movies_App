Objective:
My task is like building the UI for an Movies Clone Page based
on the provided Figma design. The page should display a list of Movies, and
each Movie should have an option to either movie name the descrption and there cast. There will be no dedicated movie page, so when a user clicks "movie image"
Additionally, when users click "movie image," a modal should open, as per ui
design.
